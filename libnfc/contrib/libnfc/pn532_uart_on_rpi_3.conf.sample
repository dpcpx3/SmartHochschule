## Typical configuration file for PN532 device on R-Pi 3 connected using miniUART
## Note: Changes have been made to R-Pi 3 with the addition of Bluetooth LE
## The UART is now being used by the BLE module. Instead of disabling it, you can 
## use the PN532 device with the "mini UART", which is still hijacked by the linux kernel 
## as a serial console
##
## Tested recipe with PN532 breakout from Adafruit
##
## To enable uart on GPIO, add this line to bottom of /boot/config.txt
## enable_uart=1
##
## Stop and disable serial console:
## $ sudo systemctl stop serial-getty@ttyS0.service
## $ sudo systemctl disable serial-getty@ttyS0.service
##
## Remove console from /boot/cmdline.txt by removing: 
## console=serial0,115200 Save and reboot for changes to take effect.
